# Interactive-AirlineBooking-System-Fall-2019-Database-design-and-implementation-
for DataBase course project

### Introduction
For this project, we use Python-based web implementation with Flask and enhance the front-end design with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The database is connected with python through Flask using mysql.connector to realize information communications between the front- end and the back-end. Also, we enables the within-page user interactions by using Ajax / XHR with fetch api. In this way, we allow a more flexible experience of web browsing and exploring for users from different categories with different functional requirements.
